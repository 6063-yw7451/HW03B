## Summary
This code is using nested for() loops to create different circles, and using Random() to change the position of circles, make them look like an irregular pattern.

## Plan
Since Homework03A created two different sizes circles, I decided to use the same grids in HW03A. Then I added random xoff & yoff to let the circles moving in the grid. I calculated the maximum value to make sure circles will not overlap each other. I also set RandomSeed to prevent circles from dancing around.

## Hard & Fun
The most diffcult part is making sure circles are not overlapping by only using for() loops. I need to calculate the value of each variation carefully.
